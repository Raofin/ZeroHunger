# Zero Hunger
ZeroHunger was the [mid-term assignment](/Readme_md/ZeroHunger.txt) (Fall, 2022-23) of my Advanced Programming with .NET course. The main focus was on developing a complex database and connecting it with ASP.NET MVC.

It is a food collection and distribution management system for an NGO. The features and functionalities of this project include:
- Restaurants can post requests for their surplus food, providing descriptions and expiry dates.
- The request list shows all the available and pending requests.
- Employees can be assigned to collect and distribute the food.
- Requests are automatically marked as expired after their expiry dates.
- New employees and restaurants can be added and their details can be viewed and modified.
- A history log shows the food collection and distribution activities.
